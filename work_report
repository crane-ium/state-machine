Version: Barkeshli
Note: I am using git for version control so this is the branch for my class submission

Bugs:
[FIXED]Sometimes ignores alpha type tokens at the end of strings

Issues:
The console-output copy did not include the field width spacing
It seems unoptimized and the code is messier than I would like
Would rather use vectors for the table
I think i did certain features differently than the 'client' described them
-Only because i made them better
I should have better try-catch and asserts in my program
